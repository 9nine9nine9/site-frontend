## About me
I am a second-year student of
Computer Science
(and maybe Mathematics)
at the University of Edinburgh.

My interests in CS areas are in
programming language theory,
type theory,
compiler design,
operating systems and low level computing,
and hardware synthesis.
I'm also interested in security,
though mainly as a hobby.

My mathematical intrigues lie mostly in
category theory
and abstract algebra,
as well of course in (meta-)logic.

Outside of the nerd life,
I enjoy casual rowing,
reading,
and eclectic (read: bad) music.


## About this site
This site is generated
from a set of markdown files using
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
(and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)),
and served to you using
[Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) and
[Warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp).
It's hosted on a VPS from
[Contabo](https://contabo.com).
I thoroughly recommend all of these.

The CSS I'm currently using is
a modified
[tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
This allows for the nice side and margin notes
you can see throughout my site.
To aid writing with this, I use
[pandoc-sidenote](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-sidenote)
in my pandoc compiler to convert
standard markdown footnote syntax
into sidenotes and margin notes.

Any code snippets on this site are
released into the public domain,
except where otherwise noted.
All art assets are my copyright,
except where otherwise noted.
